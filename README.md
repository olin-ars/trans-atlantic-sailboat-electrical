# The First Autonomous Transatlantic Sailboat

This repository contains the KiCad projects, footprint libary and schematic library for the OARS electrical subteam. _OARS.pretty_ contains schematic footprints for all of the components we need to build our PCBs. _OARS.lib_ contains the schematic symbols for all our PCB schematic.

## Organizational Etiquette
Please keep all symbols used in any project within the library. Any externally downloded symbols should be put in _OARS.lib/ext_ and imported into the main symbol library. Likewise, all footprints should be put into the footprint library.

This means that project repositories should contains **only the minimum number of files required for KiCad to operate (+ a PDF export).**
